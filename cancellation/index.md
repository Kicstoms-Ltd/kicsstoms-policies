# Cancellation policy

*Last updated: June 6, 2022*

We want satisfied customers, not hostages. That’s why we make it easy for you to cancel your account directly in all of our apps — no phone calls required, no questions asked.

<!-- Need to change this -->
<!-- Account owners can follow these instructions to cancel in-app:
*HEY: if you’ve paid for HEY, navigate to "Account & Billing" from the Me menu (top-right corner of the app) and select "Cancel your subscription". You can continue using your account until your paid period expires and your account is automatically canceled, or you can close it earlier after your subscription is stopped, from the "Account & Billing" section, selecting "Close your account now". If you haven’t paid for HEY, you can directly close your account from the "Account & Billing" section. -->

Our legal responsibility is to account owners, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If for whatever reason you no longer know who the account owner is, [contact us]({{ site.email_support }}). We will gladly reach out to any current account owners at the email addresses we have on file.

## What happens when you cancel?

You won’t be able to access your account once you cancel.

We’ll permanently delete your account data 30 days after cancellation from our servers and logs, and within 60 days from our backups. Retrieving data for a single account from a backup isn’t possible, so if you change your mind you’ll need to do it within the first 30 days after cancellation. **Data can’t be recovered once it has been permanently deleted.**

## Kicstoms-initiated cancellations

We may cancel accounts if they have been inactive for an extended period:

- For Kicstoms Sellers' Lounge accounts:
  - after 180 days of inactivity, the account will be frozen
  - after 365 days of inactivity, the account will be cancelled and closed

We also retain the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any reason at any time, as outlined in our [Terms of Service](../terms/index.md). In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in [abusive behavior](../abuse/index.md).
