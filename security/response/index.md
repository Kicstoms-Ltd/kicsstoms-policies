# Security response

## We appreciate your concern

Keeping customer data safe and secure is a huge responsibility and a top priority. We work hard to protect our customers from the latest threats. Your input and feedback on our security is always appreciated.

## Reporting security problems

**If your account is under an attack** such as hacking or [mailbombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_bomb), send us an email at [shield@kicstoms.com](mailto:shield@kicstoms.com). We will respond and work with you to counter the attack.

<!-- **Report security vulnerabilities** via [our bug bounty program on HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/basecamp). We’ll review your report and get back to you as soon as we can, usually within 72 hours. Please email our [Security team]({{ site.email_security }}) if you have questions about the bug bounty program or don’t hear back from us on HackerOne in a timely manner. -->

**For other urgent or sensitive reports**, please email our [Security team]({{ site.email_security }}).

<!-- If you feel it necessary, use [our public key](../Basecamp-security.pub) to keep your message safe and please provide us with a secure way to respond. We’ll respond as soon as we can. Please follow up or [ping us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/basecamp) if you don’t hear back. -->

**For requests that aren’t urgent or sensitive**: submit a [support request]({{ site.email_support }}).

<!-- ## Tracking and disclosing security issues

We work with security researchers to keep up with the state-of-the-art in web security. Have you discovered a web security flaw that might impact our products? Please let us know. If you [submit a report](https://hackerone.com/basecamp/reports/new), here’s what will happen:

* We’ll acknowledge your report.
* We’ll triage your report and determine whether it’s eligible for a bounty.
* We’ll investigate the issue and determine how it impacts our products. We won’t disclose issues until they’ve been fully investigated and patched, but we’ll work with you to ensure we fully understand severity and impact.
* Once the issue is resolved, we’ll post a security update along with thanks and credit for the discovery.

Our products are built on the Ruby on Rails framework (which we created and maintain). The issue you reported might affect Rails, Ruby, or some other part of our technology stack. We ask for your patience while we also make sure other companies and their customers are protected. Either way, you’ll always have a Basecamp contact for your issue. -->
